/**
 * The folding layout where the number of folds, the anchor point and the
 * orientation of the fold can be specified. Each of these parameters can be
 * modified individually and updates and resets the fold to a default (unfolded)
 * state. The fold factor varies between 0 (completely unfolded flat image) to
 * 1.0 (completely folded, non-visible image).
 * 
 * This layout throws an exception if there is more than one child added to the
 * view. For more complicated view hierarchy's inside the folding layout, the
 * views should all be nested inside 1 parent layout.
 * 
 * This layout folds the contents of its child in real time. By applying matrix
 * transformations when drawing to canvas, the contents of the child may change
 * as the fold takes place. It is important to note that there are jagged edges
 * about the perimeter of the layout as a result of applying transformations to
 * a rectangle. This can be avoided by having the child of this layout wrap its
 * content inside a 1 pixel transparent border. This will cause an anti-aliasing
 * like effect and smoothen out the edges.
